** Terrible Insult Generator **

By January Gorsline

** Purpose **

This is an application designed to randomly generate horrible insult phrases from
two lists of words: adjectives and nouns. You can scroll through each list and 
select a word or phrase using the check boxes, and save whatever insults you like in
your favorites tab. You can also check the definitions of each phrase if you're not
familiar with its meaning.

** API Usage **

Each list is saved as a JSON object and is cross-referenced with two seperate APIs,
at the user's request. Both lists were gathered from word lists and pared down slightly
as to not be too obscene. Miriam Webster's Collegiate Dictionary and the Urban Dictionary 
Node package. The user can press "random insult" to scroll to and select one word from
each list, and check the dictionary definitions of each word in either dictionary. 

** Development Problems **

The biggest problem in making this app was working with the Miriam Webster API, which
definitely needs to be organized better. Once that was sorted, getting the UI to feel
functional enough for deployment became the second-hardest challenge. 

** Successes & Failures **

The UI is pretty bare-bones, but functional enough. If I were to expand this project, I
would start by making it easier to navigate, making it clearer which words are selected
from each list. I'd also work on making it responsive. 

Everything works as intended, but another feature that might be nice would be the 
ability to add words to each of the lists, so that the user can create their own 
insults. 

** Above & Beyond **

The clear level of polish and use of multiple APIs should make this an above & beyond 
level project.
